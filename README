Two non-standard R libraries are used in this repository and their installation instructions are given below.

Installation of CVXR

# Make sure you have devtools
require(devtools)

# Specify the GitHub repository
github_repo <- "cvxgrp/CVXR"

# Specify the branch name or commit hash
github_branch <- "WIP_gurobi_solver_status"

# Install the package from the specific branch
devtools::install_github(repo = github_repo, ref = github_branch)


Installation of Gurobi

1. Download gurobi
2. Get license file
3. Put license in /opt/gurobi/ directory
4. Follow R specific instructions in Gurobi manual to install R package
5. Update .profile so that dynamic library loading works with Gurobi. On linux, the profile will read

export GUROBI_HOME="/opt/gurobi1003/linux64"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib"

The first line should be modified appropriately on Mac or Windows operating systems.


Testing that CVXR can access Gurobi:

To ensure that CVXR can access Gurobi inside R, navigate run the R notebook found in examples/ex_cvxr.Rmd


Testing all other dependencies:
In Rstudio, you can execute the unit tests for this package by running

require(devtools)
devtools::test()

If all dependencies are working, the tests should all pass.
