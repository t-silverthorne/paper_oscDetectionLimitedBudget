CVXR and Gurobi are necessary. Setting up each package with R is explained in their respective documentation. An additional step is required for RStudio integration. The gurobi paths must be set not only in your .bashrc file but also in .profile. 

Following CVXR and gurobi install instructions, updating .profile, and rebooting should make gurobi work in R.


Need to use this approach to get CVXR to put timelimit on gurobi
# Specify the GitHub repository
github_repo <- "cvxgrp/CVXR"

# Specify the branch name or commit hash
github_branch <- "WIP_gurobi_solver_status"

# Install the package from the specific branch
devtools::install_github(repo = github_repo, ref = github_branch)




Need to install cvxpy old version in order for it to work with dsp-cvxpy


Gurobi backend in python is currently unused


SCIPOPTSUITE needs to be installed externally so that pyscipopt will install in python and you can then used cvxpy to do MIQP (Gurobi does not appear to handle this conic formulation)



Need to use pip to get most dependencies, but this messes up SCIP. 

You can get SCIP to compile, on mac may need to pass compiler flag cmake .. -DAUTOBUILD=on
Compilation didn't work
