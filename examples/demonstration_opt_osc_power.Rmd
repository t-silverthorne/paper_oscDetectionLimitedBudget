# Overview
The purpose of this notebook is to illustrate how to use the solvers included in this package.

All solvers are accessed using the opt_osc_power wrapper. They are split into 
(1) Discrete versus continuous time
(2) Presence of lattice constraints

Item (1) is relevant if you only want to consider solutions that fall on a particular grid, for instance you cut a 24hr study into 5 minute intervals and only consider measurement times happening at those intervals.

Item (2) is relevant if you want to find near-optimal designs that can be decomposed into unions of uniform grids. This is convenient for experiments that want a balance between high statistical power with ease of implementation.
