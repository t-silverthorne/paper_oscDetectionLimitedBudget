Meeting notes:
- Use R/cvxr_utils.R as template for documentation (summarised version of Word document)
- Examples would also be useful to add, see here https://roxygen2.r-lib.org
- devtools::build_manual() generates the PDF output

Kernel density paper:
- Likelihood ratio test is same as OLS? 
- Why Wald test instead of likelihood ratio test? Finite sample size effect?
- Can we keep things convex if we do weighted least squares + KDE
- Why are they doing KDE?
