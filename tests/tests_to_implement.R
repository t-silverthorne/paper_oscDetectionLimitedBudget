# Useful to have the following:
# 
# 1. Compare definition of quadmats, L1, Linfty
# 2. Compare definition of cost functions (2 tests) and power (2 tests)
# 3. Compare results of optimization (naive power in matlab vs simulated annealing in R)
# 4. Compare simulated annealing and CVXR optimization in R
